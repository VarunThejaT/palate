Hello and welcome to the Palate-sponsored podcast, where we explore the world of sports performance and injury prevention. Today's guest is Eric Crecy, President and Co-founder of Crecy Sports Performance. We'll be discussing a wide range of topics, including low back pain, and how to prevent and treat it for athletes.

Crecy brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table, particularly with his background in training baseball players. One of the key takeaways from our conversation is the importance of individualized treatment when it comes to low back pain. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, as each person's history of activity and symptoms will present differently.

We also dove into the limitations of radiology and orthopedics in dealing with non-homogenous conditions like low back pain. Crecy emphasized that imaging should be seen as a piece of the diagnostic puzzle rather than the definitive answer, and that physical exams and case history should also be taken into account.

In addition to physical factors, we discussed the role of psychosocial stress and sleep deprivation in injury risk and prevention for athletes. We also talked about the emerging use of biologics in treating low back pain.

Moving on to alignment, we talked about the importance of having good alignment to increase the chance of being in a better position when performing movements. We discussed how gravity affects the body and provide clues on movement issues. Additionally, Crecy outlined general and specific movement screens used to assess potential problems leading to lower back pain, such as loading aberrant patterns and losing variability.

Our conversation also touches on the prevalence of tendinopathy in young basketball players. We discussed how movement proficiency can help prevent it, using the example of poor thoracic mobility in desk-bound individuals and suggesting various exercises.

We then shifted gears to focus on the fascial system and popular modalities for manipulating it, including dry needling, pin and stretch techniques, and cupping. The biggest misconception about the fascial system, noted Crecy, is that it doesn't work. Massage also has its place, he says, but these techniques should be performed by professionals within their scope of practice.

Crecy concluded our conversation by discussing the importance of movement diagnosis when it comes to rehabilitating an injury. He shares his own experience with a shoulder injury that wasn't properly addressed through traditional physical therapy, leading him to seek a specialist in Active Release Technique (ART). He emphasizes the importance of advocating for oneself as a patient, asking questions, and seeking specialized care when necessary.

In closing, it's clear that Eric Crecy is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to sports performance and injury prevention. His approach to individualized treatment and focus on movement competency is one that all athletes and fitness enthusiasts can benefit from. Thanks for listening to this Palate-sponsored podcast, and we'll see you next time.
